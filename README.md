Simulation Model to estimate the propagation and impact of a pandemic.  Analyzed and defined various parameters to predict the data for the COVID 19 cases in India.  Used statistical algorithm and polynomial regression to predict the values and found the relation between the various parameters through Sensitivity Analysis.  Plotted graphs for various possibilities and analyzed trends and seasonality.
